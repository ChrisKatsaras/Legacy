the earth. I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the
Elves, immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf
lords, great miners and craftsman of the mountain halls. And nine...
nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land
of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in
secret a master ring to control all others. And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life. One ring to
rule them all. One by one, the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power
of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Men and
Elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the slopes of Mount
Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
