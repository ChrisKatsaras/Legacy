!*****************
!Known limitations
!*****************
!1.Spaces in inputted equation may cause incorrect output
!e.g 1   + 2 * (3-  2) = NOT SUPPORTED :(
!e.g 1+2*(3-2) = SUPPORTED :) 
!2.Equations should be inputted with NO spaces for best results
!3.Equations cannot be longer than 40 symbols (Approved by Prof Wirth)
